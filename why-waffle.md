## Why Waffle? 
GitHub is today's most powerful tool for developer collaboration. With over 10 million users and 25 million repositories, GitHub is the preferred place to collaborate on code. 

**If you want to collaborate on the planning, organization, and status of projects hosted in GitHub, it is difficult. Another tool with another source of record is needed for *every member of the team**

Waffle extends the collaborative power of GitHub to *teams* with a simple, visual view of what's up next, what's in progress, and what's recently finished. All of your work lives in GitHub -- Waffle provides the interface and some additional project management functionality to track the work you're already doing with speed and ease. 

With Waffle, teams can move fast, stay close to their code, and keep everything and everyone working together.
