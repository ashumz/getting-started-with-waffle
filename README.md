## Getting Started with Waffle.io 

This 5 step visual guide will start you off with the basics of [Waffle](http://waffle.io), simple and smart project management for GitHub. 

**What is Waffle?**

Waffle is a lightweight project management solution for your GitHub repositories. Waffle's source of record is GitHub. GitHub Issues and PR's transform into cards on a board making it easier to plan, organize, and track your work across one or many repositories.

## Step 2: Login at [Waffle.io](http://waffle.io)

- Navigate to [Waffle.io](http://waffle.io) and click "Sign up" or "Get Started". 
- Choose whether you want to use Waffle for a Public or Private repository. To read more about the permissions we need and why, see our [documentation](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/wiki/FAQs#oauth-permissions).

## Step 3: Add a repository and Waffle it!

- Click the green + icon to see your existing boards or [add a new one in GitHub](https://github.com/new).
- Once you see the repository you want to transform into a Waffle board, click on the title to Waffle it. 
- Once viewing the board, select "Let's go!" from the top blue banner as the final step. Your repository is now also viewable as a Waffle board. ![gettingstarted2-createproject](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/100216/9798536/88cd8af2-57cf-11e5-8fda-557528c18111.gif)

## Step 4: Invite your team to join
Waffle [moves work in progress for you](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/wiki/FAQs#autoworktracking) in certain cases, but it works best if everyone on your team has logged in to Waffle at least once. (Otherwise, we use your user name to move work for others.)

Invite all collaborators easily by sharing your board link with them (you can tweet public boards if you want to share your workflow with others.)

## Step 5: Customize your board

### Customize your board
Want to add a column to your board or configure the way we automatically track your team's work? Click the gear icon on the sidebar to access your Project Settings.

### Add Sources (more repos!) 
Add multiple repositories (as many as you want!) to a single Waffle board to get a big picture view of your project(s). [Read more >>](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/wiki/FAQs#multirepo)

### Customize labels for your columns 
Already using labels in GitHub? You can map your columns to those labels, and issues will automatically populate in the appropriate columns. Or use the defaults and create new labels as needed.

### Configure automatic work tracking to fit your workflow 
By default, we send your pull requests into your Needs Review column and connect issues and pull requests together when you reference them with closing or connect keywords. We'll automatically move issues to Done when you merge work into your default branch too. But you can do so much more! We suggest [this workflow](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/wiki/Recommended-Workflow-Using-Pull-Requests-&-Automatic-Work-Tracking) for fast-moving development teams.
