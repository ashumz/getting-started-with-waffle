# Getting Started Guide for Waffle.io
Learn the basics of [Waffle](http://waffle.io), your simple project management solution for GitHub. Start leveraging the collaborative power of GitHub for your entire team.

## Why Waffle? 
GitHub is today's most powerful tool for developer collaboration. With over 10 million users and 25 million repositories, GitHub is the preferred place to collaborate on code. 

**If you want to collaborate on the planning, organization, and status of projects hosted in GitHub, it is difficult. Another tool with another source of record is needed for *every member of the team**

Waffle extends the collaborative power of GitHub to *teams* with a simple, visual view of what's up next, what's in progress, and what's recently finished. All of your work lives in GitHub -- Waffle provides the interface and some additional project management functionality to track the work you're already doing with speed and ease. 

With Waffle, teams can move fast, stay close to their code, and keep everything and everyone working together.

## How do Waffle & GitHub Work Together?
Waffle turns your Issues and Pull Requests for one or more GitHub repositories into cards on a task board, similar to Trello. Just like Trello, everyone on your team can use Waffle, regardless of technical knowledge. Unlike Trello, all of your data and team work lives in one place: GitHub. 

**Waffle helps teams better plan, organize, and track the work they're doing in GitHub.**

## Invite your team 
Waffle [moves work in progress for you](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/wiki/FAQs#autoworktracking) in certain cases, but it works best if everyone on your team has logged in to Waffle at least once. (Otherwise, we use your user name to move work for others.)

Invite all collaborators easily by sharing your board link with them. 

## Customize your board
Want to add a column to your board or configure the way we automatically track your team's work? Click the gear icon on the sidebar to access your Project Settings.

## Add Sources (more repos!) 
Add multiple repositories (as many as you want!) to a single Waffle board to get a big picture view of your project(s). [Read more >>](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/wiki/FAQs#multirepo)

## Choose labels for your columns 
Already using labels in GitHub? You can map your columns to those labels, and issues will automatically populate in the appropriate columns. Or use the defaults and create new labels as needed.

## Start Organizing Issues 
Already have issues? Start dragging them around and ordering by priority. Don't have issues yet? Add them quickly and easily from your board's "Add Issue" button.
