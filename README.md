### Learn the basics of [Waffle](http://waffle.io), your simple project management solution for GitHub. Ship software faster by leveraging the collaborative power of GitHub for your entire team.
Waffle transforms the work in your GitHub repositories into cards on a board. Use it for code or non-code projects to organize and visualize issues and pull requests. 

Check out how we use Waffle on our public board [here](http://waffle.io/waffleio/waffle.io).

### Invite your team to join!
Waffle [moves work in progress for you](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/wiki/FAQs#autoworktracking) in certain cases, but it works best if everyone on your team has logged in to Waffle at least once. (Otherwise, we use your user name to move work for others.)

Invite all collaborators easily by sharing your board link with them (you can tweet public boards if you want to share your workflow with others.)

## Make the Most out of Your Waffle Board

### Customize your board
Want to add a column to your board or configure the way we automatically track your team's work? Click the gear icon on the sidebar to access your Project Settings.

### Add Sources (more repos!) 
Add multiple repositories (as many as you want!) to a single Waffle board to get a big picture view of your project(s). [Read more >>](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/wiki/FAQs#multirepo)

### Customize labels for your columns 
Already using labels in GitHub? You can map your columns to those labels, and issues will automatically populate in the appropriate columns. Or use the defaults and create new labels as needed.

### Configure automatic work tracking to fit your workflow 
By default, we send your pull requests into your Needs Review column and connect issues and pull requests together when you reference them with closing or connect keywords. We'll automatically move issues to Done when you merge work into your default branch too. But you can do so much more! We suggest [this workflow](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/wiki/Recommended-Workflow-Using-Pull-Requests-&-Automatic-Work-Tracking) for fast-moving development teams.
