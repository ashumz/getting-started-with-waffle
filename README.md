*[Waffle](http://waffle.io) is the simple, visual way to plan, organize, and manage work for teams using [GitHub](http://github.com).*

# Getting Started Guide for Waffle.io
Learn the basics of Waffle to start leveraging the collaborative power of GitHub for your entire team.

## Why Waffle? 
GitHub is today's most powerful tool for developer collaboration. With over 10 million users and 25 million repositories, GitHub is the preferred place to collaborate on code. 

But what if you want to collaborate on the planning, organization, and status of that code? You need something more than what GitHub offers. Waffle extends the collaborative power of GitHub to *teams.* 

## How do Waffle & GitHub Work Together?
Waffle turns your Issues and Pull Requests for one or more GitHub repositories into cards on a task board, similar to Trello. Just like Trello, everyone on your team can use Waffle, regardless of technical knowledge. Unlike Trello, all of your data and team work lives in one place: GitHub. 


**Waffle helps teams better plan, organize, and track the work they're doing in GitHub.**

## Invite your team 
Waffle [moves work in progress for you](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/wiki/FAQs#autoworktracking) in certain cases, but it works best if everyone on your team has logged in to Waffle at least once. (Otherwise, we use your user name to move work for others.)

Invite all collaborators easily by sharing your board link with them.

## Add Sources (more repos!)

## Choose labels for your columns 
Already using labels in GitHub? You can map your columns to those labels, and issues will automatically populate in the appropriate columns. Or use the defaults and create new labels as needed.

## Start Organizing Issues 
Already have issues? Start dragging them around and ordering by priority. Don't have issues yet? Add them quickly and easily from your board's "Add Issue" button.
