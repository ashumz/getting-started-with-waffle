# Getting Started Guide for Waffle.io
**Waffle helps teams better plan, organize, and track the work they're doing in GitHub.**

## Invite your team 
Waffle [moves work in progress for you](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/wiki/FAQs#autoworktracking) in certain cases, but it works best if everyone on your team has logged in to Waffle at least once. (Otherwise, we use your user name to move work for others.)

Invite all collaborators easily by sharing your board link with them.

## Customize your board
Want to add a column to your board or configure the way we automatically track your team's work? Click the gear icon on the sidebar to access your Project Settings.

## Add Sources (more repos!) 
Add multiple repositories (as many as you want!) to a single Waffle board to get a big picture view of your project(s). [Read more >>](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/wiki/FAQs#multirepo)

## Choose labels for your columns 
Already using labels in GitHub? You can map your columns to those labels, and issues will automatically populate in the appropriate columns. Or use the defaults and create new labels as needed.

## Start Organizing Issues 
Already have issues? Start dragging them around and ordering by priority. Don't have issues yet? Add them quickly and easily from your board's "Add Issue" button.
